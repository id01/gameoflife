Web implementation of the game in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkGZ2Hl1l8c) youtube video with a few upgrades.  

# How to play
Red controls the red cells. Blue controls the blue cells.  
Red goes first, but blue gets an extra cell at the beginning of the game.  
When it's your turn, you choose to kill a cell or to burn two or more cells to create a cell at another location.  
If you run out of cells, you lose.  
Your goal is to make the opponent run out of cells.  
To kill, select the cell to kill and press "kill".  
To burn, select an empty cell and press "burn", then click the cells to burn, which will be highlighted orange. Click "burn" again to finalize the move.
